# Test for minitest-rails 3.0.0.rc1

## UPDATE

This is because `ActionController::TestCase` is deprecated in Rails 5 and will be removed in 5.1. Use `ActiveDispatch::IntegrationTest` instead. It only becomes an issue if you are using the Spec DSL provided by `minitest-rails`.

TL;DR

Use:

```ruby
# GOOD
describe WelcomeController do

  it "shows index" do
    get root_path
  end

end
```

instead of:

```ruby
# BAD
describe WelcomeController do

  it "shows index" do
    get :index
  end

end
```

This demonstrates a problem I'm having with `minitest-rails 3.0.0.rc1` and `rails 5.0.0.rc1`. I've built a very simple Rails 5 app that just has a `welcome#index` route. When I run the tests I get this:

```
bill@mbp minty-test-5$ rails test
Running via Spring preloader in process 91995
Run options: --seed 51295

# Running:

E

Error:
WelcomeController#test_0001_shows index:
URI::InvalidURIError: bad URI(is not URI?): http://www.example.com:80index
    test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb:6:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'


bin/rails test test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb:5



Finished in 0.399182s, 2.5051 runs/s, 0.0000 assertions/s.

1 runs, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 1 errors, 0 skips
```

It looks like the domain doesn't have a trailing backslash so the URI is not valid:

```
http://www.example.com:80index
```

I'm not quite sure why, but the previous version I was using was from over a year ago. The `working-version` branch of this app... well, it works. It uses [commit acea177b38d78d723a1ff236b8b013410c3ca3be](https://github.com/blowmage/minitest-rails/commit/acea177b38d78d723a1ff236b8b013410c3ca3be) from Dec 4, 2014.

I should probably do a bisect to narrow it down...

Any ideas?
